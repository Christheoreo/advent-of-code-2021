# Advent Of Code 2021

## About me & this repository

I tried this last year and did not make it even half way :( so this year I aim to finish all the problems!

I am using Go to solve these issues as I don't get to use it at work and I simply love it.

If you are attempting AOC, then don't look at my soloutions and come back another time ;)

## Structure

To keep things in order in directories, I have decided to use the phonetic alphabet for each day,E.g. Alpha = 01, Bravo = 02 ...

Is this a good idea? Probably not! But it seems good in my head currently!

Followed this [LINK](https://qvault.io/golang/golang-project-structure/) for structuring the project.
